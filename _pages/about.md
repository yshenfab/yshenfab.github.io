I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney (UTS),
supervised by [Prof. Chin-Teng Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nubkF1cAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yuhui Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xSvAHWgAAAAJ).
My research focuses on AI and its applications in multi-agent systems.

Previously, I accumulated over 10 years of industry experience in the fields of AI and robotics.
I received my B.E. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2013.

I am **<span style="color:red">open for collaboration</span>**. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested.
